1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve? 
- The goal of my app will be to act as a digital meal/calorie tracker. It will allow a user to be able to log in and enter their daily food intake. It will connect to an external API to retrieve the calories of certain foods and enter that information into a database that is tracking their daily totals. It will allow users to set a calorie goal and then compare their daily intake to that goal to see if they are at a calorie deficit or surplus as well as see information about the macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates and fat) in each meal. It will also allow the user to enter a weekly weight to track their weight loss. It will also include a mood tracker.

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users? 
- The target demographic for my users will be young adults from the age of 20-35 years of age. They would be health conscious individuals who are trying to keep track of their fitness goals. It would be ideal for people who are at the beginning of their health journey and would need a quick and easy way to begin achieving their goals. Their goals would be to track their calorie intake to lose/maintain weight, gain muscle, or to track how food makes them feel.

3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. 
- I plan on allowing a user to enter the name of a food and the API to provide the caloric total, the protein, the carbohydrates and the fat content. It will also allow a user to enter their caloric and weight goals data, as well as their mood for the day. It will show them data that compares their results to their goals.

4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information: 
    a. What does your database schema look like? 
        - Users table - stores the data about the user such as their username, name, goal calorie intake, goal weight.
        - Meal table - has a foreign key of user_id. Has columns of item, user_id, calories, protein (g), carbohydrates(g), and fat(g), date(foreign key to daily table?)
            - Will create a “meal” that will calculate the calorie total for foods added to a form. We will query this table to retrieve all the meals for a specific user to get their daily totals.
        - Daily total table - has a foreign key of user_id. Columns of date, daily total for calories, carbs, protein and fats, mood tracker (rating 1-5), weight
            - Will take a sum of the calories and other macronutrients based on the dates in the meal table to 
    b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? 
        - An issue I may run into with the API is ensuring the form pulls the correct data or allowing the API to pull multiple options so the user can choose the correct one. Food can be tricky because different things have different names.
    c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure? 
        - I will password protect their data like weight/weight goal, mood, and meals. 
    d. What functionality will your app include? 
        - There will be forms to gather information about the user, their progress. There will be a form to collect user’s food intake and then search the API for the corresponding data. This will then store the data to a database that will keep track of the calories and then aggregate that data to show daily totals and progress.
    e. What will the user flow look like? 
        - Log in, there will be a profile page that has your daily information first. Any meals you have already entered will be there and then there will be a form to add a new meal. Then you can click on different pages which will lead to routes that show you your progress, or you can view historical data that you have entered.
    f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch goals? 
        - A stretch goal would be to have a system where you can add another user as a friend and perhaps share certain data with them. Maybe for a competition option or just an accountability partner.
